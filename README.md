# Manufacturing Production Analysis & Strategy

## Overview
This project serves as a strategic tool for analyzing manufacturing performance, specifically comparing **Planned Production** vs. **Actual Production**. It acts as a data scientist strategist's workbench to identify gaps, track efficiency, and forecast future performance trends.

## Features
- **Data Simulation**: Generates realistic 6-month historical manufacturing data including trend, seasonality, and day-to-day variability.
- **Executive Dashboard**:
    - **Time Series Tracking**: Visualizes Planned vs. Actual production units over time.
    - **Adherence Ratio**: Tracks the daily efficiency ratio (Actual / Planned) to identify consistency.
    - **Efficiency Distribution**: Analyzes the spread of daily performance.
- **Strategic Forecasting**:
    - **Trend Analysis**: Forecasts the Adherence Ratio for the next 30 days using linear regression.
    - **Automated Insights**: Generates strategic summaries (Positive, Negative, or Stable trends) based on the forecast slope.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd production_analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook production_vs_planned.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells to:
    - Generate the simulation data.
    - Render the interactive Plotly dashboard.
    - View the strategic forecast and automated insights at the bottom of the notebook.

## File Structure
- `production_vs_planned.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the simulation, visualization, and forecasting logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies list (pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn, etc.).
